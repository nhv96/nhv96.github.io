Hi, I'm Nguyen Hoang Vinh, a software engineer based at Viet Nam with over 5 years of experience in the software development
industry. Since 2018, I have honed my skills in various areas, and in 2022, I became deeply involved in
backend development and DevOps. Since then, I have been dedicated to advancing my knowledge in
backend technologies, continuously self-teaching and taking courses in database management systems,
algorithms, and DevOps practices. My ultimate goal is to become a trusted expert with a comprehensive
understanding of the systems I work on.
